# Real-Time Motion Detector with OpenCV

This project uses the device's camera and the **OpenCV** library to detect motion in real time by comparing consecutive frames.

# Objective
Implement a simple computer vision system capable of identifying areas with movement and visually highlighting them.

# Applied Concepts
- Real-time video capture
- Grayscale conversion
- Smoothing using Gaussian Blur
- Frame difference detection
- Binary thresholding and dilation
- Contour detection and bounding box drawing

# Tools
- Python 3
- OpenCV
